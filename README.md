    """
```

## üî¨ Spectral Index Analysis

### 1. üå± Vegetation Health (NDVI)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red) = (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04)`

**Spectral Physics**:
- **B04 (Red, 665nm)**: Strongly absorbed by chlorophyll for photosynthesis
- **B08 (NIR, 842nm)**: Strongly reflected by healthy vegetation leaf structure
- **Contrast**: Healthy vegetation shows dramatic difference between red absorption and NIR reflection

#### Risk Assessment Integration
```python
# NDVI-to-Risk Conversion Logic
vegetation_risk = np.where(
    ndvi > 0.6,   # Dense vegetation (forests, healthy crops)
    3,            # Moderate risk: Storm damage potential, but fire-resistant when moist
    np.where(
        ndvi > 0.2,   # Medium vegetation (grasslands, sparse trees)
        5,            # Medium risk: Balanced fire and storm risk
        7             # High risk: Sparse vegetation = fire-prone, less storm protection
    )
)
```

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Fire Risk**: Low NDVI = dry, sparse vegetation = high fire risk
- **Storm Risk**: High NDVI = dense vegetation = potential wind damage
- **Crop Risk**: NDVI trends indicate crop health and yield potential
- **Flood Risk**: Vegetation patterns affect water runoff and absorption

### 2. üíß Water Stress (NDMI)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `NDMI = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR) = (B08 - B11) / (B08 + B11)`

**Spectral Physics**:
- **B08 (NIR, 842nm)**: High reflectance for vegetation, less affected by water content
- **B11 (SWIR, 1610nm)**: Strongly absorbed by water molecules in plant tissue
- **Water Detection**: High NDMI = NIR >> SWIR = high water content

#### Risk Assessment Integration
```python
# NDMI-to-Risk Conversion Logic
water_risk = np.where(
    ndmi > 0.3,   # High moisture content
    3,            # Lower fire risk due to moisture
    np.where(
        ndmi > -0.1,  # Medium moisture content
        5,            # Medium fire risk
        8             # High fire risk due to drought stress
    )
)
```

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Drought Risk**: Low NDMI = water stress = crop failure risk
- **Fire Risk**: Low NDMI = dry vegetation = high fire risk
- **Irrigation Monitoring**: NDMI trends indicate irrigation effectiveness
- **Seasonal Patterns**: NDMI reveals seasonal moisture cycles

### 3. üè¢ Urban Detection (NDBI)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `NDBI = (SWIR - NIR) / (SWIR + NIR) = (B11 - B08) / (B11 + B08)`

**Spectral Physics**:
- **B11 (SWIR, 1610nm)**: Higher reflectance from built materials (concrete, asphalt, metal)
- **B08 (NIR, 842nm)**: Very high reflectance from vegetation, lower from built surfaces
- **Urban Enhancement**: Built surfaces show opposite spectral behavior to vegetation

#### Risk Assessment Integration
```python
# NDBI-to-Risk Conversion Logic
urban_risk = np.where(
    ndbi > 0.1,   # Dense development
    7,            # High property risk
    np.where(
        ndbi > -0.2,  # Mixed development
        4,            # Medium property risk
        2             # Low property risk
    )
)
```

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Property Density**: Higher NDBI = more infrastructure = higher economic exposure
- **Urban Planning**: Identify development patterns and growth trends
- **Evacuation Planning**: Map population density for emergency response
- **Infrastructure Assessment**: Monitor urban expansion and density changes

### 4. üî• Burn Detection (NBR)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `NBR = (NIR - SWIR2) / (NIR + SWIR2) = (B08 - B12) / (B08 + B12)`

**Spectral Physics**:
- **B08 (NIR, 842nm)**: High for healthy vegetation, dramatically reduced by fire damage
- **B12 (SWIR2, 2190nm)**: Sensitive to char and ash, increases after burning
- **Fire Detection**: Burned areas show low NIR and high SWIR2 = low/negative NBR

#### Risk Assessment Integration
```python
# NBR-to-Risk Conversion Logic
burn_risk = np.where(
    nbr > 0.3,   # Healthy unburned vegetation
    2,            # Low fire risk
    np.where(
        nbr > 0.1,  # Medium vegetation health
        5,            # Medium fire risk
        8             # High fire risk
    )
)
```

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Post-Fire Assessment**: Quantify burn severity and damage extent
- **Fire Risk Mapping**: Identify fire-prone areas before incidents
- **Recovery Monitoring**: Track vegetation regrowth after fires
- **Temporal Analysis**: Compare pre-fire vs post-fire conditions

### 5. üè† Roof Vulnerability (BREI - Custom Index)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `BREI = (B11 + B04 - B08 - B02) / (B11 + B04 + B08 + B02)`

**Multi-Band Logic**:
- **B02 (Blue, 490nm)**: Atmospheric interference reduction
- **B04 (Red, 665nm)**: Enhances dry building materials (concrete, metal)
- **B08 (NIR, 842nm)**: Vegetation suppression (vegetation has high NIR)
- **B11 (SWIR, 1610nm)**: Building materials enhancement (dry surfaces)

#### Physical Interpretation
```javascript
// Numerator (B11 + B04 - B08 - B02):
//   + B11 (SWIR): Enhances dry building materials signal
//   + B04 (Red): Enhances reflectance of roof materials like concrete/metal
//   - B08 (NIR): Removes vegetation signal (vegetation has high NIR)
//   - B02 (Blue): Removes atmospheric/water interference
//
// Result: Positive values indicate exposed roof materials vulnerable to weather damage
```

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Hail Damage Risk**: Identify vulnerable roof materials (metal, asphalt shingles)
- **Wind Damage Assessment**: Detect exposed vs protected roofing
- **Material Analysis**: Differentiate roof types (tile, metal, membrane)
- **Maintenance Prioritization**: Flag roofs needing protective measures

### 6. üåä Drainage Assessment (DOPI - Custom Index)

#### Scientific Foundation
**Formula**: `DOPI = (1 - NDVI) * (B11 / B08)`

**Component Analysis**:
```javascript
// Step 1: Calculate NDVI for vegetation density
const ndvi = (s.B08 - s.B04) / (s.B08 + s.B04);

// Step 2: Inverse vegetation factor (sparse vegetation areas)
const inverse_vegetation = (1 - ndvi);

// Step 3: Moisture/built-up factor (SWIR/NIR ratio)
const moisture_buildup_factor = (s.B11 / s.B08);

// Step 4: Combined drainage obstruction indicator
const dopi = inverse_vegetation * moisture_buildup_factor;
```

**Physical Interpretation**:
- **High DOPI**: Sparse vegetation + high moisture/built surfaces = potential drainage problems
- **Low DOPI**: Well-vegetated areas or dry natural surfaces = good drainage
- **Application**: Identifies blocked drains, waterlogging, flood-prone areas

**Insurance Applications**:
- **Flood Risk**: Identify areas with poor water drainage
- **Urban Planning**: Map drainage efficiency in developed areas
- **Waterlogging Detection**: Find areas prone to water accumulation
- **Infrastructure Assessment**: Evaluate drainage system performance

## üéØ Risk Calculation Methodology

### Individual Risk Scoring (1-10 Scale)

Each satellite index is converted to insurance risk scores using scientifically-based thresholds:

```python
RISK_SCALE_INTERPRETATION = {
    "1-2": "Very Low Risk (minimal insurance concern)",
    "3-4": "Low Risk (standard coverage adequate)", 
    "5-6": "Moderate Risk (enhanced monitoring recommended)",
    "7-8": "High Risk (premium adjustment consideration)",
    "9-10": "Critical Risk (immediate attention required)"
}
```

### Composite Risk Algorithm

```python
def calculate_composite_risk(risk_layers):
    """
    Final risk score = Average of all available individual risk factors
    
    Advantages:
    - Ensures missing data doesn't bias results
    - Provides comprehensive coverage when all factors available
    - Maintains consistent 1-10 scale regardless of factor availability
    - Allows partial analysis when some APIs fail
    """
    total_risk = np.zeros(reference_shape, dtype=np.float64)
    factor_count = 0
    
    for layer_name, layer_data in risk_layers.items():
        total_risk += layer_data.astype(np.float64)
        factor_count += 1
    
    composite_risk = total_risk / factor_count if factor_count > 0 else 5.0
    return np.clip(composite_risk, 1, 10)  # Ensure 1-10 range
```

## üìà Time Series & Trend Analysis

### Temporal Analysis Architecture

#### Time Period Segmentation
```python
def generate_time_periods(start_date, end_date, interval_months):
    """
    Algorithm:
    1. Start from user-provided start date
    2. Create analysis periods of 3 months duration each
    3. Advance by user-specified interval (3, 6, or 12 months)
    4. Continue until end date is reached
    
    Example Timeline:
    2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 (6-month intervals)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Period 1: 2023-01-01 to 2023-03-31 (Analysis: 2023-03-31)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Period 2: 2023-07-01 to 2023-09-30 (Analysis: 2023-09-30)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Period 3: 2024-01-01 to 2024-03-31 (Analysis: 2024-03-31)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Period 4: 2024-07-01 to 2024-09-30 (Analysis: 2024-09-30)
    """
```

    """
```

## üîß Error Handling & Resilience

### API Failure Management

```python
def generate_simple_fallback(size=(256, 256), bbox=None):
    """
    Fallback Strategy for API Failures:
    
    1. Realistic Data Generation: Random values with realistic ranges
    2. Location-Based Variation: Use coordinates for regional patterns
